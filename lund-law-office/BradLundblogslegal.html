			<h2>NEW IN 2019!</h2>
			
			<p>This relaunch of my website has been a long time coming.   I've closed down all but a few clients regarding my private practice of nearly twenty years and am now available as a consultant, and to discuss how the law is changing within emergent technologies. </p>
			
			<p>I'm not alone in sensing that the practice, and implementation of the U.S. legal system has significant challenges ahead to 'catch up' with how today's clients expect the law to serve them.</p>
			
			<p>This site will also have practical information for you to consider before contacting an attorney to assist you with legal matters.   Unfortunatley, I'm not accepting any new clients at this time.   However, I am available to other attorneys for consultation and collaboration.</p>
			
			<h3>Topics To Be Covered</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Emergence of the Blockchain and Cryptoassets and How it Relates to the Law</li>
				<li>Lawyers Need to Code and Understanding the Emergence of AI into Law Practice</li>
				<li>Colorado-Specific Real Estate Issues</li>
				<li>Advice For When You are Clearly Suspected of a Crime</li>
				<li>First Steps if You Are Involved in an Accident</li>
				<li>Bankruptcy "Dos and Dont's"</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I will be importing and updating previous article from my website in this space, in January 2019.</p>
